# Stage 3/4: Deadlines are scary, aren't they?
## Description
Every day we’re surrounded by thousands of small distractions, facts, and bits of odd information. When you’re facing  
a deadline, you don’t have time for all this fluff. You need to focus on the task at hand. You can’t afford to  
spend hours on Pinterest, chatting with your coworkers, or watching re-runs on TV.

Let's add the ability to set the deadlines for our tasks. For this, we need to use the Python `datetime` module.  
Here are some methods that can help you:
```markdown
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

datetime.today() # returns the current date and time
datetime.today().date() # the current date without time
datetime.today().time() # the current time without date

datetime.strptime(date_string, format) # returns a datetime corresponding to the date_string, parsed according to format.
# Format example: '%Y-%m-%d' - '2020-04-24'

today = datetime.today()
today.day # today's day
today.strftime('%b') # the short name of the current month, for example, Apr
today.weekday() # returns the day of the week as an integer; Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.

yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1) # a timedelta object that represents a duration, the difference between two dates or times.
day_after_tomorrow = today + timedelta(days=2)
```

To select the rows based on a certain condition, use the `filter()` method that accepts a condition:
```markdown
from datetime import datetime

today = datetime.today()
rows = session.query(Table).filter(Table.date == today.date()).all()
```

In the code snippet above, we have selected all rows from `Table` where the date column is today's date. To sort the  
selected data, you can use `order_by()` that accepts a sorting column:
```markdown
# select all rows ordered by the date column
session.query(Table).order_by(Table.date).all()

# select all rows where string_fields starts with 'L'. The result is ordered by the date column
session.query(Table).filter(Table.string_field.startswith('L'))).order_by(Table.date).all()
```

## Objectives
Add the following items to your menu:
* `Week's tasks`. It prints all tasks for the next 7 days from today;
* `All tasks`. It prints all tasks sorted by the deadline;
* The `Add a task` item should ask for the deadline of the task. Users need to input the deadline in the  
  following format: `YYYY-MM-DD`;
* The `Today's tasks` item should also print today's date (refer to the Example section for the format).

## Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
