# Stage 1/4: Plan it!
## Description
Do you have 10 minutes a day to add an extra $4000 to your monthly income?

This is the difference between people who write down their goals and those who don’t. That’s one of many reasons  
why having a To-Do list can improve your work and personal life. You can use it to reduce stress in your life and  
be more productive. It also helps you become more persistent and save time for the best things in your life.

In this project, you will create a to-do list that will help you organize your life.

## Objectives

To begin with, develop a simple list that contains four tasks. Your program must print the list in the example.

## Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
