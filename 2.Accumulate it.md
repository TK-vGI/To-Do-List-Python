# Stage 2/4: Accumulate it!
## Description

It's not good that when you close the to-do list application, the tasks disappear. To avoid this, you need to create  
a database where you can store all information about your tasks. We will use **SQLite** to create a database  
and **SQLAlchemy**  to manage the database from Python.

First, you need to create a database file. To create it, use the `create_engine()` method, where `file_name` is  
the database file name:
```markdown
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///file_name?check_same_thread=False')
```

The `check_same_thread=False` argument connects a database from another thread. Please, set it as described,  
as the tests require it. Otherwise, you will get an exception.

Once you've created your database file, you need to create a table inside. First, create a **model class** that  
describes the table in the database. Consider a piece of code below when doing it:
```markdown
class Table(Base):
    ...
    string_field = Column(String, default='default_value')
    date_field = Column(Date, default=datetime.today())

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.string_field

```

* `String_field` is a string column; `default='default_value'` indicates that the default value of this column is  
  `default_value`;
* `Date_field` is a column that stores the date. SQLAlchemy automatically converts the SQL `date` into a Python `datetime`  
  object;
* The `__repr__` method returns a string representation of the class object. In the ORM concept, each row in the table is an   
  object of a class.

Once you are done with the table description, you need to add it to the database. This will create a table in the  
database by generating SQL queries according to the described models. Now, we can access the database.  
To do this, create a session.

The `session` object is the only thing you need to manage the database. This is how you can create a new row in the table:
```markdown
new_row = Table(string_field='This is a string field!',
         date_field=datetime.strptime('01-24-2020', '%m-%d-%Y').date())
```
To get all rows from the table, you can pass the model class to the `query()` method that selects all rows from the  
table represented by a model class:
```markdown
rows = session.query(Table).all()
```
The` all()` method returns all rows from the table as a Python list. Each element of this list is an object  
of the model class. You can access the row fields by their names:
```markdown
first_row = rows[0] # In case rows list is not empty

print(first_row.string_field) # Will print the value of the string_field
print(first_row.id) # Will print the id of the row
print(first_row) # Will print the string that was returned by the __repr__ method
```

## Objectives
To complete this stage, you need to arrange the data storage in the database. Here's what you need to do:
* Create a database file. Name it as `todo.db`;
* Create a table in this database. Name it as `task`.

The table `task` should have the following columns:
* An integer column named `id`. Arrange it as the `primary key`;
* A string column named `task`;
* A date column named `deadline`. It should have the date when the task was created by default.  
  You can use the `datetime.today()` method.

Also, you need to implement a menu that will make your program more convenient. The menu should have the following items:
* `Today's tasks.` It prints all the tasks for today;
* `Add a task.` It asks for task descriptions and saves them in the database;
* `Exit.`

## Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
### Example 1: _an example of the program output_
```markdown
1) Today's tasks
2) Add a task
0) Exit
> 1

Today:
Nothing to do!

1) Today's tasks
2) Add a task
0) Exit
> 2

Enter a task
> Prepare a presentation
> The task has been added!

1) Today's tasks
2) Add a task
0) Exit
> 1

Today:
1. Prepare a presentation

1) Today's tasks
2) Add a task
0) Exit
> 0

Bye!
```
